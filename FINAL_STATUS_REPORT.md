## ⚠️ **OPTIONAL REMAINING**

### **Payment Processing for Promotions** (Optional)
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Impact:** Low (promotions work but don't charge coins)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Time:** 2-3 hours

**What it does:**
- Deducts coins when user selects "Featured" or "Boost" promotion
- Validates wallet balance before promotion
- Refunds coins if job is rejected

**Why it's optional:**
- Job posting works perfectly without it
- Can be added later as feature enhancement
- Not critical for MVP launch
