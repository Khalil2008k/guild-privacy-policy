# ✅ Password Reset - FIXED!

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### **Problem:**
- Account recovery was simulating email sending (not real)

- You never received the recovery email

### **Solution:**
✅ **Now using Firebase's built-in password reset system**
- Real emails sent directly from Firebase
- Works even when backend is down
