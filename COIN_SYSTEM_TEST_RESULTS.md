## 🧪 **HOW TO TEST (Once Deployment Completes)**

### **Step 1: Check Render Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select "guild-backend" service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for: "Your service is live 🎉"

### **Step 2: Test Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl https://guild-yf7q.onrender.com/health
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T...",
  "database": {
    "primary": "Firebase",
    "firebase": "connected"
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Test Coin Catalog**
```bash
curl https://guild-yf7q.onrender.com/api/coins/catalog
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "coins": [
      {
        "name": "Guild Bronze Coin",
        "symbol": "GBC",
        "value": 5,
        "color": "#CD7F32",
        "description": "Bronze tier coin",
        "icon": "🥉"
      },
      {
        "name": "Guild Silver Coin",
        "symbol": "GSC",
        "value": 10,
        "color": "#C0C0C0",
        "description": "Silver tier coin",
        "icon": "🥈"
      },
      {
        "name": "Guild Gold Coin",
        "symbol": "GGC",
        "value": 50,
        "color": "#FFD700",
        "description": "Gold tier coin",
        "icon": "🥇"
      },
      {
        "name": "Guild Platinum Coin",
        "symbol": "GPC",
        "value": 100,
        "color": "#E5E4E2",
        "description": "Platinum tier coin",
        "icon": "💎"
      },
      {
        "name": "Guild Diamond Coin",
        "symbol": "GDC",
        "value": 200,
        "color": "#B9F2FF",
        "description": "Diamond tier coin",
        "icon": "💠"
      },
      {
        "name": "Guild Royal Coin",
        "symbol": "GRC",
        "value": 500,
        "color": "#4B0082",
        "description": "Royal tier coin - highest value",
        "icon": "👑"
      }
    ],
    "totalTiers": 6
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Test Authenticated Endpoint**
You'll need a Firebase auth token. Get one from your app, then:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://guild-yf7q.onrender.com/api/coins/wallet
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "userId": "...",
    "balances": {
      "GBC": 0,
      "GSC": 0,
      "GGC": 0,
      "GPC": 0,
      "GDC": 0,
      "GRC": 0
    },
    "totalValue": 0,
    "lastActivity": null,
    "stats": {
      "totalPurchased": 0,
      "totalReceived": 0,
      "totalSpent": 0,
      "totalWithdrawn": 0,
      "purchaseCount": 0,
      "jobsPosted": 0,
      "jobsCompleted": 0,
      "withdrawalCount": 0
    }
  }
}
```

1. Verify routes registered in server.ts
2. Check build completed successfully
3. Verify no TypeScript errors
4. Check route path is correct

### **If Authentication Fails**
1. Verify Firebase token is valid
2. Check token not expired
3. Verify firebaseAuth middleware working
4. Check Firebase project ID matches
