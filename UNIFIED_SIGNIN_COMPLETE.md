# ✅ Unified Sign-In System - COMPLETE

## 🎉 **ONE Sign-In Screen That Handles Everything!**

The GUILD app now has a **smart, unified sign-in screen** that automatically detects and handles:

1. 📧 **Email** (e.g., `user@gmail.com`)
2. 📱 **Phone Number** (e.g., `+974 3344 5566`)
3. 🆔 **Guild ID** (e.g., `GUILD-12345`)

---

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

### **Smart Input Detection**

The sign-in screen now has **ONE intelligent input field** that:

✅ **Detects what you're typing in real-time**
- Typing `+974...` → Detects as 📱 **Phone**
- Typing `user@...` → Detects as 📧 **Email**
- Typing `GUILD-...` → Detects as 🆔 **Guild ID**

✅ **Adapts the UI automatically**
- Shows the appropriate icon (📱, ✉️, or 🆔)
- Changes keyboard type (phone keypad for numbers, email keyboard for email)
- Shows/hides password field (phone auth doesn't need password)
- Updates button text ("Continue" for phone, "Sign In" for email/GID)

✅ **Routes to the correct authentication method**
- **Phone** → Navigates to SMS verification screen
- **Email/GID** → Signs in with email/password

---
