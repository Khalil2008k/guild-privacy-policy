# 🔍 ENHANCED LOGGING DEPLOYED

## Date: October 22, 2025 - 03:10 UTC

---

## ✅ **WHAT I JUST DID:**

Added **detailed console logging** to the Firebase authentication middleware to diagnose why tokens are being rejected.

**Commit:** `f8fdd6d` - "debug: add detailed Firebase token verification logging"  
**Status:** 🔄 **Deploying to Render** (2-3 minutes)

---

## 🔍 **NEW LOGS YOU'LL SEE:**

### When Token Verification Starts:
```
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] About to verify token for path: /api/payment/demo-mode
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Token prefix: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Firebase Project ID: guild-dev-7f06e
```

### If Verification Succeeds:
```
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Token verified successfully! User ID: 1TwSrYTugUSF7V0B31jXkTlMKgr1
```

### If Verification Fails:
```
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] VERIFICATION FAILED!
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Error Code: auth/id-token-expired (or other code)
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Error Message: (detailed error message)
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Path: /api/payment/demo-mode
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Firebase Project ID: guild-dev-7f06e
```

## 🧪 **WHAT TO DO NEXT:**

### Step 1: Wait for Render (2-3 minutes)
- Check https://dashboard.render.com
- Wait for "Your service is live 🎉"

### Step 2: Test the App Again
- Use the app normally
- Try to access wallet, chats, etc.

### Step 3: Check Render Logs
- Go to Render dashboard
- Click on your service
- View the logs
- **Look for the new `🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH]` console logs**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WE'LL DISCOVER:**

The enhanced logs will tell us EXACTLY why the backend is rejecting the tokens:

### Possible Causes:
1. **Project ID Mismatch**: Backend using wrong Firebase project
2. **Token Expired**: Token is old/expired
3. **Invalid Token**: Token format is wrong
4. **Audience Mismatch**: Token is for different project
5. **Signature Verification Failed**: Token signature doesn't match

---

## 📋 **TIMELINE:**

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 03:10 | Enhanced logging committed |
| 03:10 | Pushed to GitHub |
| 03:11 | Render auto-deploy triggered |
| ~03:13 | **Expected: Deploy complete** |
| 03:13+ | **Test app & check logs** |

---

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT:**

Once Render finishes deploying:
1. **Use the app** (try to access wallet, chats, etc.)
2. **Immediately check Render logs**
3. **Copy the `🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH]` logs**
4. **Share them with me**

Then we'll know EXACTLY what's wrong and can fix it!

**Check Render in 2-3 minutes, then test the app!** 🔍
