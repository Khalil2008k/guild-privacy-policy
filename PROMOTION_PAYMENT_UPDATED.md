# ✅ Promotion Payment System - UPDATED

**Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** (Updated Implementation)

---

## 🎯 **Updated Behavior**

The promotion payment system now validates balance **immediately when user tries to select promotions**, not just at submission.

---

## ✅ **Updated Flow**

### **Old Flow (Submission Time Validation):**
1. User selects Featured/Boost
2. User clicks "Submit Job"
3. System validates balance ❌
4. If insufficient → Error alert

### **New Flow (Immediate Validation):**
1. User clicks Featured/Boost toggle
2. System checks balance **immediately** ✅
3. If insufficient → Error alert with "Buy Coins" button
4. If sufficient → Promotion enabled
5. User can continue without interruption

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Changes**

### **1. New Handler Function: `handlePromotionToggle()`**

**Location:** `src/app/(modals)/add-job.tsx`

**Logic:**
```typescript
const handlePromotionToggle = (type: 'featured' | 'boost', currentValue: boolean) => {
  // Turning OFF - always allowed
  if (currentValue) {
    handleInputChange(type, false);
    return;
  }

  // Turning ON - check balance first
  const newCost = calculatePromotionCost() + (type === 'featured' ? 50 : 100);
  const walletValue = calculateWalletValue();

  if (walletValue < newCost) {
    // Show error and redirect to buy coins
    CustomAlertService.showError(...);
    return;
  }

  // Balance sufficient - allow toggle
  handleInputChange(type, true);
};
```

### **2. Updated Promotion Toggles**

**Before:**
```typescript
onPress={() => handleInputChange('featured', !formData.featured)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
onPress={() => handlePromotionToggle('featured', formData.featured)}
```

## 📊 **User Experience**

### **Scenario 1: Insufficient Balance**
1. User has 30 coins
2. Clicks "Featured" toggle
3. System calculates: current balance (30) < required (50)
4. Shows error: "Insufficient balance. Required: 50 coins. Current balance: 30 coins."
5. Offers "Buy Coins" button
6. User redirected to coin store
7. Promotion remains OFF

### **Scenario 2: Sufficient Balance**
1. User has 100 coins
2. Clicks "Featured" toggle
3. System calculates: current balance (100) >= required (50)
4. Promotion enabled immediately ✅
5. User can continue

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Promotions**
1. User has 150 coins
2. Selects "Featured" → Enabled (cost: 50)
3. Selects "Boost" → Enabled (cost: 100, total: 150)
4. Both promotions active ✅

### **Scenario 4: Toggling OFF**
1. User has promotions selected
2. Clicks to turn OFF
3. Always allowed (no balance check needed)
4. Promotions disabled immediately
