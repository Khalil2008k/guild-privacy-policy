## To: Fatora Support

**Subject:** Native Mobile SDK Request for GUILD App Integration

---

Dear Fatora Support Team,

I am integrating Fatora payment gateway into the **GUILD mobile application** (built with React Native/Expo).

I've reviewed your [Mobile Integration documentation](https://fatora.io/api/mobileIntegration.php) which mentions that you offer **native SDKs for iOS and Android applications**. I would like to implement the native SDK approach instead of WebView integration for a better user experience.

**Could you please provide:**

1. **React Native SDK** (if available)
   - npm package or GitHub repository
   - Integration documentation
   - Code examples

2. **Native iOS SDK** (if React Native SDK not available)
   - CocoaPods or manual installation
   - Swift/Objective-C documentation
   - UI components

3. **Native Android SDK** (if React Native SDK not available)
   - Gradle/Maven installation
   - Kotlin/Java documentation
   - UI components

4. **SDK Features Documentation:**
   - Card input components
   - Tokenization API
   - 3D Secure support
   - Custom UI styling options
   - Error handling
   - Testing/sandbox mode

5. **Example Projects:**
   - Sample React Native app (preferred)
   - Sample iOS app
   - Sample Android app

**My Current Setup:**
- Platform: React Native (Expo)
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Fatora API Key: `E4B73FEE-F492-4607-A38D-852B0EBC91C9` (Test Mode)
- Integration Goal: Native in-app payment experience

**Current Implementation:**
I have successfully implemented the Standard Checkout API with WebView approach. However, for better UX, I'd like to switch to the native SDK if available.

Please let me know:
- Availability of React Native SDK
- Access to SDK downloads
- Documentation links
- Any additional setup requirements

Looking forward to your response!

**Best regards,**

[Your Name]

## Alternative: Check Fatora Documentation

### **Fatora SDKs Page:**

According to their website structure, the SDKs page should be at:
- [https://fatora.io/api/sdks.php](https://fatora.io/api/sdks.php)
- Or look for "SDKs" link in the left sidebar of: [https://fatora.io/api/](https://fatora.io/api/)

### **Fatora Dashboard:**

1. Login to [Fatora Dashboard](https://fatora.io)
2. Look for "Developers" or "Integration" section
3. Check for SDK downloads
4. Look for documentation links

## If Native SDK Not Available

### **Alternative Options:**

1. **Use Tokenization API**
   - Create your own card form
   - Tokenize card with Fatora
   - Process payment with token
   - More complex, but fully native

2. **Use WebView (Current Approach)**
   - Easier implementation
   - Less native feel
   - Still works perfectly

3. **Request Custom SDK Development**
   - Ask Fatora to create React Native SDK
   - Provide your requirements
   - May require enterprise plan
