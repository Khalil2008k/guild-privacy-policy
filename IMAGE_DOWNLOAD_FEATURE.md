## üé® UI Implementation

### 1. Download Button on Image Preview
**Location:** Top-right corner of image thumbnail

**Design:**
- Semi-transparent black background (`rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`)
- White download icon (18px)
- Circular button with padding
- Positioned at `top: 10, right: 10`
- Visible on hover/always visible

**Code:**
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity 
  onPress={() => onDownload?.(message.attachments?.[0] || '', message.fileMetadata?.originalName || 'image.jpg')}
  style={styles.imageDownloadButton}
  activeOpacity={0.7}
>
  <Download size={18} color="#FFFFFF" />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 2. Download Button in Full-Screen Modal
**Location:** Top-right, next to close button

**Design:**
- Same semi-transparent style
- Larger icon (24px) for better visibility
- Positioned at `top: 50, right: 80`
- Closes modal and triggers download

**Code:**
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.downloadButtonFullImage}
  onPress={() => {
    setShowFullImage(false);
    onDownload?.(message.attachments?.[0] || '', message.fileMetadata?.originalName || 'image.jpg');
  }}
>
  <Download size={24} color="#FFFFFF" />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## üíæ Download Functionality

### How It Works

1. **User clicks download button**
2. **System detects if it's an image** (checks file extension)
3. **Downloads to device storage** using `FileSystem.downloadAsync()`
4. **Opens share dialog** with proper MIME type (`image/*`)
5. **User can save to gallery** from share options

### Code Flow

```typescript
const handleDownloadFile = async (url: string, filename: string) => {
  // 1. Detect if image
  const isImage = /\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)$/i.test(filename) || url.includes('image');
  
  // 2. Show loading alert
  CustomAlertService.showInfo('Downloading', 'Saving image...');
  
  // 3. Download to temp directory
  const docDir = FileSystem.documentDirectory;
  const safeFilename = filename.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g, '_');
  const fileUri = docDir + safeFilename;
  const downloadResult = await FileSystem.downloadAsync(url, fileUri);
  
  // 4. Open share dialog
  await Sharing.shareAsync(downloadResult.uri, {
    mimeType: 'image/*',
    dialogTitle: 'Save Image',
  });
  
  // 5. Show success message
  CustomAlertService.showSuccess('Success', 'You can now save the image from share options');
};
```

## üí° Why Not Auto-Save?

**Question:** "Are images auto-saved in local storage?"

**Answer:** **No, and here's why:**

### Privacy & Storage Concerns
1. **User Consent:** Auto-saving without permission violates privacy
2. **Storage Space:** Could fill up device storage quickly
3. **Unwanted Content:** User might not want all images saved
4. **Platform Guidelines:** Both iOS and Android require user action for gallery saves

### Best Practice
- **User Control:** Let users decide what to save
- **On-Demand:** Download only when user clicks button
- **Transparent:** Clear feedback when saving
- **Compliant:** Follows platform guidelines

### Current Implementation (Best of Both Worlds)
‚úÖ Images cached in app for fast loading  
‚úÖ User can save to gallery with one tap  
‚úÖ User has full control  
‚úÖ No unwanted storage usage  
‚úÖ Privacy-compliant  

---

## üìä Storage Behavior

### Where Images Are Stored

1. **In-App Cache (Automatic)**
   - Location: App's cache directory
   - Purpose: Fast loading in chat
   - Cleared: When app cache is cleared
   - Size: Managed by system

2. **Device Gallery (User Action)**
   - Location: Photos/Gallery app
   - Purpose: Permanent storage
   - Cleared: Only by user
   - Size: User's responsibility

3. **Firebase Storage (Permanent)**
   - Location: Cloud storage
   - Purpose: Sync across devices
   - Cleared: Never (unless admin deletes)
   - Size: Unlimited (for practical purposes)
