## ⚠️ FRONTEND STATUS: **NEEDS MINOR CLEANUP**

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)
**None** - All critical issues resolved!

### Minor Issues (Recommended to Fix)

#### 1. **Mock Data in Payment Methods Screen** 🟡
**File:** `src/app/(modals)/payment-methods.tsx` (Lines 43-85)
**Issue:** Hardcoded mock payment methods (4 cards/banks)
**Impact:** Low - These are UI-only and don't affect real transactions
**Recommendation:** Replace with API calls to fetch real payment methods from backend
**Status:** Non-blocking for production

#### 2. **Console.log Statements** 🟡
**Count:** 936 instances across 145 files
**Issue:** Debug logging statements throughout the codebase
**Impact:** Low - Performance impact minimal, but unprofessional
**Recommendation:** 
- Keep critical logs (authentication, errors)
- Remove debug logs (search queries, UI interactions)
- Use conditional logging based on `__DEV__` flag
**Status:** Non-blocking for production

#### 3. **TODO/FIXME Comments** 🟡
**Count:** 431 instances across 58 files
**Issue:** Incomplete features or technical debt markers
**Impact:** Low - Most are for future enhancements
**Recommendation:** Review and prioritize for post-launch sprints
**Status:** Non-blocking for production

### Test/Development Files (Safe to Keep)

#### FakePayment System (Intentional for Demo Mode)
- `src/contexts/FakePaymentContext.tsx` ✅
- `src/services/FakePaymentService.ts` ✅
- `src/components/FakePaymentDisplay.tsx` ✅
- **Purpose:** Demo mode for beta testing (controlled by backend)
- **Status:** Keep - This is a feature, not a bug

#### Test User in AuthContext (Lines 185-233)
- **Purpose:** Fallback for anonymous sign-in
- **Status:** Keep - Used for testing and demo purposes
