## 🏆 **INTEGRATION STATUS**

### **✅ ALL SERVICES INTEGRATED**

Every service in the coin system now uses the advanced serialized coin architecture:

---

## 📦 **SERVICE INTEGRATION DETAILS**

### **1. CoinPurchaseService** ✅ **INTEGRATED**
**File:** `backend/src/services/CoinPurchaseService.ts`

**Integration:**
- ✅ Calls `coinWalletService.addCoins()`
- ✅ Which now uses `AdvancedCoinMintingService.mintBatch()`
- ✅ Mints serialized coins for every purchase
- ✅ Records coin serials in ledger
- ✅ Tracks Merkle roots

**Flow:**
```
USER PURCHASES COINS
    ↓
CoinPurchaseService.createPurchase()
    ├─ Creates Fatora payment link
    └─ Waits for webhook
    ↓
CoinPurchaseService.processWebhook()
    ├─ Verifies payment
    └─ Calls issueCoinsTx()
    ↓
coinWalletService.addCoins()
    ├─ AdvancedCoinMintingService.mintBatch()
    │   ├─ Generates unique serials with checksums
    │   ├─ Creates coin instances
    │   ├─ Builds Merkle tree
    │   └─ Links to previous batch
    ├─ Updates wallet inventory
    └─ Records in ledger with serials
    ↓
USER RECEIVES SERIALIZED COINS
```

---

### **2. CoinJobService** ✅ **INTEGRATED**
**File:** `backend/src/services/CoinJobService.ts`

**Integration:**
- ✅ Uses `coinWalletService.deductCoins()` for escrow lock
- ✅ Which now selects specific serialized coins (FIFO)
- ✅ Validates ownership of each coin
- ✅ Updates coin status in `coin_instances`
- ✅ Uses `coinWalletService.addCoins()` for payment release
- ✅ Which mints new coins for freelancer

**Flow:**
```
JOB PAYMENT ESCROW
    ↓
CoinJobService.createJobPayment()
    ├─ Selects coins from client
    └─ coinWalletService.deductCoins()
        ├─ Selects specific coins (FIFO)
        ├─ Validates ownership
        ├─ Removes from client inventory
        ├─ Updates coin status to 'spent'
        └─ Records in ledger with serials
    ↓
COINS LOCKED IN ESCROW
    ↓
JOB COMPLETED
    ↓
CoinJobService.releaseEscrow()
    ├─ Calculates freelancer share (90%)

        ├─ Adds to freelancer inventory
        └─ Records transfer in ledger
    ↓
FREELANCER RECEIVES SERIALIZED COINS
PLATFORM RECEIVES FEE COINS
```

---

### **3. CoinWithdrawalService** ✅ **INTEGRATED**
**File:** `backend/src/services/CoinWithdrawalService.ts`

**Integration:**
- ✅ Uses `coinWalletService.deductCoins()` for withdrawal
- ✅ Which selects specific serialized coins
- ✅ Validates ownership
- ✅ Updates coin status to 'withdrawn'
- ✅ Records coin serials in withdrawal record
- ✅ Coins are permanently burned (status = 'withdrawn')

**Flow:**
```
USER REQUESTS WITHDRAWAL
    ↓
CoinWithdrawalService.createWithdrawal()
    ├─ Validates KYC
    └─ coinWalletService.deductCoins()
        ├─ Selects specific coins (FIFO)
        ├─ Validates ownership
        ├─ Removes from user inventory
        ├─ Updates coin status to 'withdrawn'

## 📊 **DATA FLOW - COMPLETE LIFECYCLE**

### **Example: 100 QAR Purchase → Job Payment → Withdrawal**

```
STEP 1: PURCHASE
User buys 100 QAR of coins
    ↓
Mints: 20 serialized coins
    - 10x GBC (5 QAR each)
    - 5x GSC (10 QAR each)
    - 2x GGC (50 QAR each)
    ↓
Each coin gets:
    - Serial: GBC-20251022-000001-A3F2
    - Signature: hmac_sha256_signature
    - Merkle proof: [hash1, hash2]
    - Status: 'active'
    - Owner: userId
    ↓
Wallet inventory updated:
    active.GBC: ["GBC-20251022-000001-A3F2", ...]
    active.GSC: ["GSC-20251022-000010-B4E3", ...]
    active.GGC: ["GGC-20251022-000015-C5F4", ...]

---

STEP 2: JOB PAYMENT (50 QAR)
Guild master pays worker
    ↓
Selects coins (FIFO):
    - 1x GGC (50 QAR)
    ↓
Validates:
    - Serial checksum ✓
    - Ownership ✓
    - Status = 'active' ✓
    ↓
Deducts from guild master:
    - Removes GGC-20251022-000015-C5F4 from inventory
    - Updates coin status to 'spent'
    ↓
Mints new coins for worker:
    - 9x GBC (45 QAR for worker - 90%)
    - 1x GBC (5 QAR for platform - 10%)
    ↓
Worker receives:
    active.GBC: ["GBC-20251022-000020-D6G5", ...]
    ↓
Ledger records:
    - Guild master: transfer_out with serial GGC-20251022-000015-C5F4
    - Worker: transfer_in with new serials
    - Complete audit trail

---

STEP 3: WITHDRAWAL (45 QAR)
Worker withdraws earnings
    ↓
Selects coins (FIFO):
    - 9x GBC (45 QAR)
    ↓
Validates:
    - Serial checksum ✓
    - Ownership ✓
    - Status = 'active' ✓
    ↓
Burns coins:
    - Removes from worker inventory
    - Updates status to 'withdrawn'
    - Coins permanently burned
    ↓
Admin processes:
    - Verifies KYC
    - Transfers 45 QAR to bank
    - Marks as complete
    ↓
Worker receives cash
    ↓
Ledger records:
    - Withdrawal with coin serials
    - Complete audit trail from mint to burn
```
