## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. GID Service Tests - Mock Database Not Initialized
**Files Affected:**
- `backend/src/services/firebase/__tests__/GIDService.test.ts`
- `backend/src/__tests__/integration/GIDSystem.integration.test.ts`

**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'collection')`

**Root Cause:**
The mock database object is not being properly returned by `mockFirebaseService.getDb()`. The test setup creates a mock object but the service isn't using it correctly.

**Lines in Test:**
```typescript
const mockDb = {
  collection: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  doc: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  set: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  // ... other methods
};

mockFirebaseService.getDb.mockReturnValue(mockDb as any);
```

**What's Wrong:**
The `GIDService` is trying to call `this.db` but it's undefined because:
1. The service doesn't properly initialize `this.db` from `firebaseService.getDb()`
2. The mock is not being called correctly
3. The service might be instantiated before the mock is set up

**Solution:**
1. Fix the GIDService initialization to properly get the database instance
2. Ensure mocks are set up before service instantiation
3. Add proper beforeEach cleanup

**Number of Failing Tests:** 22 tests

### 2. Email Validation - Incorrect Regex Pattern
**Files Affected:**
- `src/utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts`
- `BROKEN_APP_BACKUP/src/utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts`

**Error:** Test expects `validateEmail('test..test@example.com')` to return `false` but returns `true`

**Root Cause:**
The email regex `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/` is too permissive. It doesn't prevent consecutive dots in the local part, which is technically invalid per RFC 5321.

**Current Regex:**
```typescript
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
```

**What's Wrong:**
- Allows `test..test@example.com` (consecutive dots)
- Allows `test.@example.com` (dot before @)
- Allows `.test@example.com` (starting with dot)

**Solution:**
Replace with a more strict regex:
```typescript
const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9._-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?@[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+$/;
```

**Number of Failing Tests:** 2 tests

### 3. XSS Sanitization - Incomplete javascript: URL Removal
**Files Affected:**
- `BROKEN_APP_BACKUP/src/utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts`

**Error:** Test expects `sanitizeInput('javascript:alert("xss")')` to return `""` but returns `"alert(\"xss\")"`

**Root Cause:**
In `src/utils/validation.ts`, the `sanitizeInput` function removes `javascript:` but leaves the rest of the string. The test expects an empty string.

**Current Implementation (line 15):**
```typescript
.replace(/javascript:/gi, '')
```

**What's Wrong:**
This removes only the `javascript:` prefix, leaving `alert("xss")` behind. The test expects complete removal of dangerous javascript: URLs.

**Solution:**
Replace javascript: URLs with empty string including the content:
```typescript
.replace(/javascript:[^"']*/gi, '')
```

Or better yet, for the test's expectation, the implementation in `validation.ts` is actually correct (removes the dangerous part). The issue is that:
1. The test in `BROKEN_APP_BACKUP` has different expectations
2. The actual implementation in `src/utils/validation.ts` already handles this correctly
3. The BROKEN_APP_BACKUP test needs to match the production implementation

**Number of Failing Tests:** 1 test

### 4. Performance Tests - Missing Base URL for Fetch
**Files Affected:**
- `tests/__tests__/performance.test.ts`

**Error:** `TypeError: Failed to parse URL from /api/v1/jobs` - Invalid URL

**Root Cause:**
The test uses relative URLs like `/api/v1/jobs` in fetch calls, but Node.js `fetch` requires absolute URLs.

**Current Code (line 10):**
```typescript
fetch('/api/v1/jobs', { method: 'GET' })
```

**What's Wrong:**
- In a browser, relative URLs work because there's a base URL
- In Node.js tests, fetch needs absolute URLs like `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/jobs`
- No test server is running to handle these requests
- No mocking is set up for fetch

**Solution:**
1. Mock the fetch API in tests
2. Or set up MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
3. Or use a test environment variable for base URL
4. Or skip these tests if they require a running server

**Number of Failing Tests:** 5 tests

---

### 5. Missing Service Modules
**Files Affected:**
- `tests/__tests__/payments.test.ts` - Can't find `../../src/services/paymentService`
- `tests/__tests__/auth.test.ts` - Can't find `../../src/services/authService`

**Error:** `Cannot find module '../../src/services/paymentService'`

**Root Cause:**
The test files import services that don't exist in the expected locations.

**Expected Path:** `src/services/paymentService.ts`
**Expected Path:** `src/services/authService.ts`

**What's Wrong:**
1. The service files were never created
2. The service files are in a different location
3. The import paths are incorrect
4. The tests were created before the services

**Solution:**
1. Check if services exist elsewhere in the codebase
2. Update import paths to correct locations
3. Create stub services if they don't exist
4. Or skip these tests until services are implemented

**Number of Failing Tests:** 2 test suites (unable to run)

### 6. Missing Testing Library for React (Admin Portal)
**Files Affected:**
- `admin-portal/src/pages/__tests__/BackendMonitor.test.tsx`

**Error:** `Cannot find module '@testing-library/react'`

**Root Cause:**
The admin portal tests import `@testing-library/react` but it's not installed in the admin portal's dependencies.

**What's Wrong:**
- The main project uses `@testing-library/react-native` (for mobile)
- The admin portal needs `@testing-library/react` (for web)
- The dependency is missing from `admin-portal/package.json` or the root

**Solution:**
Install the missing dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

**Number of Failing Tests:** 1 test suite (unable to run)

---

### 7. Chat Test - JSX Parsing Error
**Files Affected:**
- `tests/__tests__/chat.test.ts`
- `tests/utils/testHelpers.ts`

**Error:** `Unterminated regular expression` at line 17 in testHelpers.ts

**Root Cause:**
Babel is failing to parse JSX in the test helpers file. The error indicates the closing tag `</UserProfileProvider>` is being interpreted as a regex.

**Location:** `tests/utils/testHelpers.ts:17`

**What's Wrong:**
1. The file is named `.ts` instead of `.tsx` (JSX requires .tsx extension)
2. Jest configuration might not be transforming the file correctly
3. Babel preset might be missing for JSX

**Solution:**
1. Rename `tests/utils/testHelpers.ts` to `tests/utils/testHelpers.tsx`
2. Ensure Jest config includes `.tsx` files in transform
3. Verify babel-preset-expo or equivalent is configured

**Number of Failing Tests:** 1 test suite (unable to run)

---

### 8. Button Component - Missing Disabled Prop
**Files Affected:**
- `src/components/__tests__/Button.test.tsx`

**Error:** `expect(button.props.disabled).toBe(true)` - Received: `undefined`

**Root Cause:**
The Button component doesn't pass the `disabled` prop through to the underlying Pressable/TouchableOpacity component.

**Test Expectation (line 119):**
```typescript
expect(button.props.disabled).toBe(true);
```

**What's Wrong:**
The Button component receives the `disabled` prop but doesn't apply it to the rendered element's props. It might be using it for styling only.

**Solution:**
Update the Button component to pass the disabled prop:
```typescript
<Pressable disabled={disabled} style={...}>
```

**Number of Failing Tests:** 1 test

---

### 9. System Integration Tests - Mock Service Not Called
**Files Affected:**
- `src/__tests__/integration/systemIntegration.test.ts`

**Multiple Issues:**
1. Security event logging spy not being called
2. API response structure mismatch (success: false vs expected true)
3. Error message mismatch ("Authentication required but no token available" vs "Authentication required. Please sign in.")

**Root Cause:**
The mocks are not properly intercepting the actual service calls. The integration tests are calling real services instead of mocked ones.

**What's Wrong:**
1. Security service mock not intercepting logSecurityEvent calls
2. API gateway not using mocked authentication
3. Mock responses not matching test expectations

**Solution:**
1. Properly mock all service dependencies before tests run
2. Use jest.spyOn instead of manual mocking
3. Verify mocks are being called with mockClear/mockReset
4. Update error messages to match actual implementation

**Number of Failing Tests:** 5 tests
