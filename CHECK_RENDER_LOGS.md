## 🤔 Possible Causes

### 1. **Job Not Found in Backend Database**
- The job might exist in frontend Firebase but not in backend
- Backend `jobService.getJobById()` might be failing

### 2. **Firebase Connection Issue**
- Backend might not be able to read from Firebase
- Check if Firebase credentials are set in Render

### 3. **Job Document Structure Mismatch**
- Job might be missing required fields (e.g., `posterId`)
- Backend expects certain fields that don't exist

### 4. **Notification Service Error**
- Backend tries to send notification to job poster
- Notification service might be failing

## 🔍 What to Look For in Logs

```
// Expected error patterns:
❌ "Job not found"
❌ "Cannot read property 'posterId' of undefined"
❌ "Firebase: Missing or insufficient permissions"
❌ "Error sending notification"
```

## 🚀 Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Check if job exists in backend
The job might only exist in frontend Firebase, not backend database.

### Option B: Check Firebase credentials
Verify `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, etc. are set in Render.

### Option C: Check job document structure
The job might be missing `posterId` or other required fields.
