# ✅ CHAT REAL-TIME LISTENER - FIXED

## 🐛 Problem

The chat items weren't showing up for test users even though the chats existed in Firestore.

**Root Cause:**
- `ChatContext` was using `chatService.getUserChats()` which only loaded chats once
- No real-time listener was set up
- When new chats were created, the app didn't detect them
- Required manual app refresh to see new chats

---

## ✅ Solution

### **1. Added Real-Time Listener to ChatService**

Created `listenToUserChats()` method that:
- Uses Firestore `onSnapshot` for real-time updates
- Listens to all chats where user is a participant
- Automatically updates when chats are created/modified
- Filters out inactive chats
- Sorts by `updatedAt` (most recent first)

### **2. Updated ChatContext**

Modified `loadChats()` to:
- Use the new real-time listener
- Return cleanup function for proper unmounting
- Update chats state automatically when changes occur

### **3. Removed Index Requirement**

Changed query from:
```javascript
// OLD - Required composite index
where('participants', 'array-contains', userId),
where('isActive', '==', true),
orderBy('updatedAt', 'desc')
```

To:
```javascript
// NEW - No index required
where('participants', 'array-contains', userId)
// Filter and sort in memory
```
