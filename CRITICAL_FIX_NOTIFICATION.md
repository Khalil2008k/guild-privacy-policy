# 🔥 CRITICAL FIX - Notification Error

## ❌ The Real Problem

The "Internal server error" was caused by **line 293** in the notification code:

```typescript
await notificationService.send({
  userId: job.posterId,  // ❌ This was undefined!
  type: 'NEW_OFFER',
  // ...
});
```

## 🔍 Why It Failed

1. We fixed the check on line 260-262 to use `jobPosterId = job.posterId || job.clientId`
2. But we **forgot** to update line 293 which still used `job.posterId` directly
3. When `job.posterId` was `undefined`, the notification service crashed
4. This caused "Internal server error"

## ✅ The Fix

Changed line 293 to use the fallback variable:

```typescript
await notificationService.send({
  userId: jobPosterId,  // ✅ Now uses the fallback variable
  type: 'NEW_OFFER',
  // ...
});
```

**Commit**: `e86337f` - "Fix: Use jobPosterId variable for notification (was causing internal server error)"
