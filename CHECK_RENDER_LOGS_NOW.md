# 🔍 URGENT: Check Render Logs for Actual Error

## ❌ Still Getting "Internal server error"

The backend is deployed but still crashing. We need to see the **actual error** in Render logs.

---

## 🚨 **ACTION REQUIRED**

**Go to Render Dashboard NOW**:
1. Open: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-ctu8s6ggph6c73bvg8og
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. Scroll to timestamp: **20:29:45** (when you tested)
4. Look for **red error messages**
5. **Copy the full error stack trace**

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

The logs will show something like:

```
❌ Error: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
    at /app/dist/routes/jobs.js:123:45
    at ...
```

Or:

```
❌ FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions
    at ...
```

Or:

```
❌ TypeError: job.something is not a function
    at ...
```

## 📋 Possible Causes

Without seeing the actual error, it could be:

1. **`jobService.getJobById()` failing**
   - Job not found in backend Firebase
   - Firebase permissions issue

2. **Job document structure mismatch**
   - Missing required fields
   - Wrong field types

3. **Notification service error**
   - Even though we catch it, might be throwing before catch

4. **Database write error**
   - Firebase rules blocking the write
   - Collection name mismatch

---

## 🎯 **PLEASE SHARE THE LOGS**

Copy the error from Render logs around **20:29:45 UTC** and share it here.

Without the actual error message, I'm working blind!

**The logs will tell us exactly what's failing!** 🔍
