## üì± **PHASE 1: Prepare App Configuration**

### Step 1.1: Update app.config.js

Your app needs proper configuration for Play Store. Let me check your current config and update it.

**Key fields needed:**
- `android.package`: Unique identifier (e.g., `com.guild.app`)
- `android.versionCode`: Integer version (increment for each release)
- `version`: Semver version string (e.g., "1.0.0")
- `android.icon`: 512x512px PNG icon
- `android.adaptiveIcon`: Adaptive icon for Android
- `android.permissions`: Required permissions list

### Step 1.2: Create App Icon

```bash
# Create 512x512px icon
# You'll need a designer or use tools like:
# - Figma
# - Canva
# - Adobe Illustrator
```

**Icon Guidelines:**
- 512x512px PNG
- No transparency in foreground
- Background can have transparency
- Follow Material Design guidelines

### Step 1.3: Configure Permissions

Review and add only necessary permissions in `app.config.js`:
```javascript
"android": {
  "permissions": [
    "CAMERA",
    "READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE",
    "WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE",
    "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",
    "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION",
    "NOTIFICATIONS"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2.3: Build Production AAB

```powershell

```

**Build Time:** 10-30 minutes
