# 🚀 READY TO BUILD - RUN THIS COMMAND

## ✅ Configuration is Complete!

You're **almost there**! The Android build uploaded successfully. Now we just need to set up iOS credentials.

---

## 📱 **RUN THIS COMMAND NOW:**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Admin\GUILD\GUILD-3
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

**DO NOT use `--non-interactive`** - we need interactive mode to set up iOS credentials.

## 🔐 **WHAT WILL HAPPEN:**

### **1. Android Build** ✅
- Already uploaded successfully!
- Will start building immediately
- Time: ~10-20 minutes

### **2. iOS Build** (Needs Your Input)

**Answer:** `Y` (Yes)

#### **Question 2: Provisioning Profile**
```
? Generate a new Apple Provisioning Profile?
