## 🔧 How We'll Fix Screens Safely

### Step 1: Backup Current State
- Git commit all changes first
- Each screen fix gets its own commit

### Step 2: Test Before Fixing
- Run app in English mode first
- Verify screen works
- Switch to Arabic mode
- Check what breaks

### Step 3: Apply Minimum Fixes
- Only fix what's broken
- Don't over-engineer
- Keep changes simple

### Step 4: Test After Fixing
- Test in English (should still work)
- Test in Arabic (should now work)
- Test on different screen sizes

## 📋 Implementation Pattern

### For Each Screen:

1. **Identify the Issue**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Hardcoded layout
   <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row' }}>
   ```

2. **Apply Fix**
   ```typescript
   // After: RTL-aware layout
   const { isRTL } = useI18n();
   <View style={{ flexDirection: isRTL ? 'row-reverse' : 'row' }}>
   ```

3. **Test**
   - ✓ English mode
   - ✓ Arabic mode
   - ✓ RTL text alignment

## 🎨 Using Advanced Components (Optional)

If you want to use the advanced components:

### Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```typescript
import { RTLView, RTLText } from '@/components/RTLWrapper';

<RTLView header>
  <RTLText>Auto-aligned text</RTLText>
</RTLView>
```

### Option B: Manual Fix (Safer)
```typescript
const { isRTL } = useI18n();
<View style={{ flexDirection: isRTL ? 'row-reverse' : 'row' }}>
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't fix screens randomly** - Follow priority order
2. **Don't over-use wrappers** - Only when beneficial
3. **Don't break English mode** - Always test both
4. **Don't rush** - One screen at a time
5. **Don't forget to commit** - After each successful fix

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

- Total screens: ~163
- Fixed: 6
- Remaining: ~157
- Critical priority: 13
- Using wrappers: Can auto-fix rest

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A screen is considered "fixed" when:
- ✅ Works perfectly in English (LTR)
- ✅ Works perfectly in Arabic (RTL)
- ✅ Text aligns correctly
- ✅ Icons position correctly
- ✅ Layout doesn't break
- ✅ No console errors

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If something breaks:
1. Git commit message shows what changed
2. Easy to revert specific changes
3. Wrapper components can be disabled
4. Each screen fix is independent

---

## 📝 Documentation

After fixing each screen:
- Update this document
- Mark screen as "✅ Fixed"
- Note any special considerations
- Test results
