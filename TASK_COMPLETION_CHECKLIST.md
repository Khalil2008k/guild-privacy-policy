## ‚ö†Ô∏è **WHAT REMAINS**

### **1. Admin Notification on Job Submission** ‚ùå MISSING
**What:** Admin should be notified when job is submitted

**Current State:**
- Job posts successfully
- **Admin doesn't get notified**
- Admin has to manually check portal

**Where to Add:**
- `src/app/(modals)/add-job.tsx` - After job creation
- Or in `src/services/jobService.ts` - In createJob method

**What Needs to Happen:**
```typescript
// After job is created successfully
await BackendAPI.post('/notifications', {
  userId: 'admin', // or get admin IDs
  type: 'JOB_PENDING_REVIEW',
  title: 'New Job Pending Review',
  message: `Job "${formData.title}" needs review`,
  data: { jobId: result.jobId }
});
```

**Priority:** HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Impact:** Admin doesn't know new jobs exist

---

### **2. User Notification on Approval/Rejection** ‚ùå MISSING
**What:** User should be notified when admin approves/rejects

**Current State:**
- Admin approves/rejects in portal
- **User doesn't get notified**
- User has to manually check "My Jobs"

**Where to Add:**
- Admin portal (`admin-portal/src/pages/JobApproval.tsx`)
- After approval/rejection action

**What Needs to Happen:**
```typescript
// In admin portal, after approving
await BackendAPI.post('/notifications', {
  userId: job.clientId,
  type: 'JOB_APPROVED',
  title: 'Job Approved',
  message: `Your job "${job.title}" has been approved`,
  data: { jobId }
});

// After rejecting
await BackendAPI.post('/notifications', {
  userId: job.clientId,
  type: 'JOB_REJECTED',
  title: 'Job Rejected',
  message: `Your job "${job.title}" was rejected: ${reason}`,
  data: { jobId, reason }
});
```

**Priority:** HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Impact:** Users don't know their job status

---

### **3. Notification on Application Received** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
**What:** Poster should be notified when someone applies

**Current State:**
- In `jobService.ts` line 223, there's a notification
- **But it's not working** (commented out notification)
- Check if it actually sends

**Where to Check:**
- `src/services/jobService.ts` - line 223
- `sendNotification` method may be disabled

**What Needs to Happen:**
- Verify notification is actually sent
- Or implement properly if disabled

**Priority:** MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Impact:** Posters don't know about applications

---

### **4. Payment Processing for Promotions** ‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIONAL
**What:** Deduct coins when user selects featured/boost

**Current State:**
- Promotions save in database
- **No payment logic**
- Coins not deducted

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Optional)  
**Impact:** Promotions work but don't charge users

**Note:** This is optional and can be added later. For production MVP, the job posting system works without it.
