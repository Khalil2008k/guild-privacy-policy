# 🚀 Guild Admin Portal - Production Setup Guide

## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP SETUP FOR REAL FIREBASE INTEGRATION**

Follow these steps to connect the admin portal to your actual Guild app data:

---

## **STEP 1: Deploy Firebase Configuration**

### 1.1 Deploy Cloud Functions
```bash
# Navigate to the main Guild project root
cd C:\Users\Admin\GUILD

# Deploy the updated Cloud Functions with admin support
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 1.2 Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
# Navigate to admin portal
cd admin-portal

# Deploy the temporary open rules for testing
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 1.3 Create Required Firestore Indexes
```bash
# Deploy the index configuration
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**OR** manually create indexes by clicking these links when you see the errors:
- Jobs index: [Create Index](https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/guild-4f46b/firestore/indexes?create_composite=...)

---

## **STEP 2: Test the Integration**

### 2.1 Create a User Account in Guild App
1. Open your Guild mobile app
2. Sign up with a new account (use your real email)
3. Complete the profile setup
4. This user will appear in the admin portal

### 2.2 Post a Job in Guild App
1. In the Guild app, post a new job
2. Fill out all job details
3. Submit the job
4. **The job will now require admin approval** and appear in admin portal

### 2.3 Access Admin Portal
1. Open admin portal: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login with: `admin@guild.app` / `admin123`
3. You should see:
   - **Users page**: Your real user account
   - **Job Approval page**: Your posted job in "Pending Review"
   - **Dashboard**: Real analytics from your data

---

## **STEP 3: Test Admin Functions**

### 3.1 User Management
- Go to **Users** page
- Find your user account
- Test actions: View profile, change status, update verification

### 3.2 Job Approval
- Go to **Job Approval** page
- Find your posted job
- Click "View Details" to see full job information
- Test: **Approve** or **Reject** the job
- **After approval**: Job becomes visible in Guild app's job feed

### 3.3 Analytics
- Go to **Dashboard**
- Verify real user count, job count, etc.
- Charts should show actual data from your Firebase

---

## **STEP 4: Production Security (After Testing)**

### 4.1 Set Up Admin Roles
```javascript
// In Firebase Console > Functions, create this function:
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// Set your user as super admin
admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims('YOUR_USER_UID', { 
  role: 'super_admin' 
});
```

### 4.2 Enable Secure Firestore Rules
Edit `admin-portal/firestore.rules`:
```javascript
// Uncomment the production rules section
// Comment out the temporary open access rule
```

### 4.3 Deploy Secure Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## **STEP 5: Deploy Admin Portal**

### 5.1 Build Production Version
```bash
cd admin-portal
npm run build
```

### 5.2 Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 5.3 Access Production Portal
- URL: `https://guild-4f46b.web.app` (or your custom domain)
- Login with your admin account

---

## **🔄 WORKFLOW AFTER SETUP**

### **User Journey:**
1. **User signs up** in Guild app → Appears in admin portal Users page
2. **User posts job** in Guild app → Appears in admin portal Job Approval page
3. **Admin reviews job** in portal → Approves/rejects with reason
4. **Approved job** → Becomes visible in Guild app job feed
5. **Freelancers apply** → Offers appear in admin portal
6. **Admin monitors** → Real-time analytics and user management

### **Admin Capabilities:**
- **User Management**: View profiles, verify identity, manage status
- **Job Moderation**: Approve/reject job postings before they go live
- **Analytics**: Monitor platform growth, revenue, user activity
- **Security**: Track admin actions, manage user reports

---

## **🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Index Errors**
If you see "The query requires an index" errors:
1. Copy the index creation URL from the console error
2. Click the link to create the index in Firebase Console
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for the index to build
4. Refresh the admin portal

### **Permission Errors**
If you see "Missing or insufficient permissions":
1. Verify Firestore rules are deployed: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. Check your user is logged in to admin portal
3. Ensure you're using the same Firebase project

### **Cloud Function Errors**
If admin actions fail:
1. Deploy functions: `firebase deploy --only functions`
2. Check Firebase Console > Functions for error logs
3. Verify your user has proper authentication
