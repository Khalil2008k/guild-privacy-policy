# 🔧 Job Cards - Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Currency Changed from QR to Coins
**Problem:** Job cards were displaying "QR" (Qatari Riyal) instead of "Coins"

**Fixed in:**
- `src/components/JobCard.tsx`
  - Changed `formatBudget()` to replace "QR" with "Coins"
  - Changed icon from `DollarSign` to `Coins`
  
- `src/app/(main)/home.tsx`
  - Search results now show "Coins" instead of "QR"
  - Job card price tags now show "Coins" instead of "QR"

**Before:**
```typescript
return `QR ${job.budget.min}-${job.budget.max}`;
<DollarSign size={16} color="#00C9A7" />
```

**After:**
```typescript
return `${job.budget.min}-${job.budget.max} Coins`;
<Coins size={16} color="#00C9A7" />
```

### 2. Text Overlap Fixed
**Problem:** Title and category icon were overlapping, details were overflowing

**Fixed:**
- Added `flex: 1` to title text to prevent overlap with category icon
- Changed `alignItems: 'center'` to `'flex-start'` in titleRow
- Added `gap: 8` between title and icon
- Added `flexShrink: 0` to categoryIcon to prevent shrinking
- Added `flexShrink: 1` to title to allow text wrapping
- Added `flexWrap: 'wrap'` to details container
- Added `maxWidth: '48%'` to detailRow to prevent overflow
- Added `numberOfLines={1}` to all detail texts

**Before:**
```typescript
titleRow: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'space-between',
  marginBottom: 4,
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
titleRow: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  alignItems: 'flex-start',
  justifyContent: 'space-between',
  marginBottom: 4,
  gap: 8,
}
```

### 3. Dummy/Mock Data Removed
**Problem:** Hardcoded dummy values like "4.2" rating and "12345" GID

**Fixed:**
- Changed default rating from `'4.2'` to `'N/A'`
- Changed default GID from `'12345'` to `'N/A'`

**Before:**
```typescript
{job.rating || '4.2'}
GID: {job.posterGID || '12345'}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{job.rating || 'N/A'}
GID: {job.posterGID || 'N/A'}
```

## 📝 Notes

### Why "Coins" instead of "QR"?
The app uses a virtual coin system where:
- Users buy coins with real money
- Coins are used for all in-app transactions
- 1 Coin = 1 QR worth of value
- This provides better control and escrow management

### Why Remove Dummy Data?
- "4.2" rating: Should only show if user has actual ratings
- "12345" GID: Should only show if user has a real GUILD ID
- "N/A" is clearer than fake data

### Layout Improvements:
- `flex: 1` on title allows it to take available space
- `flexShrink: 0` on icon prevents it from shrinking
- `gap: 8` provides consistent spacing
- `maxWidth: '48%'` prevents detail rows from overlapping
- `numberOfLines={1}` prevents multi-line overflow

## 🚀 Result

- ✅ Display coins correctly
- ✅ Have proper spacing
- ✅ Show real data only
- ✅ Work in all screen sizes
- ✅ Support RTL layout
- ✅ Look professional and clean

**All text has its proper place, no overlaps!** 🎯
