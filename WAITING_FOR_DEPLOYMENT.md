# ⏰ Waiting for Render Deployment

## 📊 Current Status

**Time**: 20:23:49 UTC  
**Status**: ❌ Still getting "Internal server error"  
**Reason**: Render is still deploying the new code

---

## 🕐 Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 20:22 | TypeScript fix pushed to GitHub |
| 20:22 | Render started building |
| 20:23 | **YOU TESTED** - Still old code running |
| 20:24-20:25 | **Expected**: Deployment completes |

---

## ⏳ Why It's Still Failing

The error at `20:23:49` means you're still hitting the **old backend code** because:

1. ✅ Code pushed to GitHub (20:22)
2. ⏳ Render is building (takes 2-3 min)
3. ⏳ Render is deploying (takes 30-60 sec)
4. ❌ Old code still serving requests

---

## 🎯 What to Do

### **Wait 1-2 more minutes**, then test again

**Expected completion**: ~20:24-20:25 UTC

### How to Know It's Ready:

1. **Check Render Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-ctu8s6ggph6c73bvg8og
   - Look for: "Deploy succeeded" with green checkmark
   - Timestamp should be after 20:22

2. **Or just wait 2 minutes** and try again

---

## 🧪 Test Again At:

**~20:25 UTC** (in about 1-2 minutes from your last test)

Then:
1. Open app
2. Go to Jobs
3. Pick a different job
4. Submit offer
5. **Expected**: ✅ Success!

## 📈 Deployment Progress

```
[████████████░░░░░░░░] 60% - Building...
```

**Estimated time remaining**: 1-2 minutes

## 💡 Pro Tip

You can tell when the new code is deployed by checking the error message:
- **Old code**: "Internal server error" (generic)
- **New code**: Specific error message or success ✅

---

**Just wait 1-2 more minutes and try again!** ⏰
