# 🚀 **FINAL SOLUTION: Development Build**

## 🚨 **THE PROBLEM:**

**Expo Go is fundamentally broken for this use case.** The Firebase Auth instance is so deeply cached that:
- ❌ Clearing AsyncStorage doesn't work
- ❌ Deleting Expo Go and reinstalling doesn't work
- ❌ Updating `messagingSenderId` doesn't work
- ❌ Restarting Expo with `--clear` doesn't work

**The token is STILL from `guild-4f46b` no matter what we do!**

---

## ✅ **THE SOLUTION: Create a Development Build**

A development build is a standalone APK with the correct Firebase config **baked in**. It doesn't share state with Expo Go.

---

## 🔧 **BUILD STEPS:**

### **1. Install expo-dev-client (DONE)**
```bash
npm install expo-dev-client --legacy-peer-deps
```

### **2. Update eas.json to fix dependency issues**

The build failed because of peer dependency conflicts. We need to add a development profile with proper configuration.

## 📝 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Check EAS build logs:** https://expo.dev/accounts/mazen123333/projects/guild-2/builds/2a4a8ff7-c37d-4592-bf8e-c3a0223862e6

2. **Fix the dependency issues** in the build

3. **Rebuild** with `eas build --profile development --platform android`

4. **Install the APK** on your device

5. **Sign in** and verify tokens are from `guild-dev-7f06e`

---

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULT:**

Once the development build is installed:
- ✅ Firebase initializes with `guild-dev-7f06e` config
- ✅ Tokens are generated for `guild-dev-7f06e`
- ✅ Backend verifies tokens successfully
- ✅ **NO MORE 401 ERRORS!**

**Status:** 🔧 **FIXING BUILD CONFIGURATION...**
