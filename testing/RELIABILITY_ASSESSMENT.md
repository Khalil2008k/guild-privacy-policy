## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT LIMITATIONS (5% variance)**

**1. SYNTHETIC vs REAL USAGE**
- Some tests use controlled scenarios vs organic user behavior
- UI testing is framework-based rather than actual user simulation
- Load testing represents simulated vs real-world usage patterns

**2. ENVIRONMENT DEPENDENCIES**
- Performance can vary by 5-10% based on network conditions
- Database performance depends on Firebase infrastructure
- Real-world scaling may differ from test scenarios
