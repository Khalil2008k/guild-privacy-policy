# 🔥 Deploy Firebase Storage Rules - QUICK GUIDE

## What We Added
- **Firebase Storage Rules** (`storage.rules`) for chat files, profile images, job attachments, and guild images
- **Firestore Rules Update** for `file_uploads` metadata collection
- **firebase.json Update** to include storage rules configuration

---

## 🚀 Deploy to Firebase (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
cd GUILD-3
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project guild-7f06e
```

### Step 2: Deploy Storage Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only storage --project guild-7f06e
```

### Step 3: Verify
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage --project guild-7f06e
```

## 📋 What the Storage Rules Allow

### ✅ Chat Files (`/chats/{chatId}/files/`)
- **Read**: Any authenticated user
- **Write**: Any authenticated user (must be part of chat to send messages)
- **Max Size**: 10MB per file
- **Use Case**: Images, documents, and files sent in chat messages

### ✅ User Profile Images (`/users/{userId}/profile/`)
- **Read**: Any authenticated user
- **Write**: Only the user themselves
- **Max Size**: 5MB per file
- **Use Case**: Profile pictures and avatars

### ✅ Job Attachments (`/jobs/{jobId}/attachments/`)
- **Read**: Any authenticated user
- **Write**: Any authenticated user (job poster)
- **Max Size**: 20MB per file
- **Use Case**: Job descriptions, portfolios, contracts

### ✅ Guild Images (`/guilds/{guildId}/images/`)
- **Read**: Any authenticated user
- **Write**: Any authenticated user (guild masters)
- **Max Size**: 5MB per file
- **Use Case**: Guild logos, banners, event images

### ✅ Admin Uploads (`/admin/`)
- **Read/Write**: Admins only
- **Use Case**: System files, announcements, promotional materials

## 🔐 Firestore Rules Update

Added `file_uploads` collection rules:
```javascript
match /file_uploads/{fileId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uploadedBy;
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uploadedBy;
}
```

This allows:
- **Read**: Any authenticated user can read file metadata
- **Create**: Users can only create metadata for files they upload
- **Update/Delete**: Users can only modify their own file metadata

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Deploy Both Rules

**You MUST deploy BOTH Firestore and Storage rules:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage --project guild-7f06e
```

If you only deploy one, the other will remain unchanged and may cause permission errors.

---

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

1. **Test Image Upload in Chat**:
   - Open job discussion screen
   - Try sending an image
   - Should upload successfully without `storage/unauthorized` error

2. **Test File Upload**:
   - Try sending a document
   - Should upload successfully

3. **Test Location Sharing**:
   - Try sharing location
   - Should work without errors

---

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `GUILD-3/storage.rules` (NEW)
2. ✅ `GUILD-3/firebase.json` (UPDATED)
3. ✅ `GUILD-3/firestore.rules` (UPDATED - added file_uploads)
4. ✅ `GUILD-3/src/services/chatFileService.ts` (FIXED - React Native compatible hashing)

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

After deployment:
- ✅ Users can upload images in chat
- ✅ Users can upload documents in chat
- ✅ Users can share location in chat
- ✅ No more `storage/unauthorized` errors
- ✅ File metadata is saved to Firestore
- ✅ Files are stored in Firebase Storage with proper paths

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still getting `storage/unauthorized`?
1. Check if rules were deployed: `firebase deploy --only storage --project guild-7f06e`
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for rules to propagate
3. Restart the app
4. Check Firebase Console → Storage → Rules tab

### Files not appearing in chat?
1. Check Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project guild-7f06e`
2. Check `file_uploads` collection in Firebase Console
3. Check browser console for errors
