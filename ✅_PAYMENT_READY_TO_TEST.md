## 🚀 **Quick Start - Test Now!**

### **1. Start Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Wait for:**
```

- Or scan QR code for physical device

### **3. Test Payment:**

**Option A: Navigate from code (easiest for testing):**

Add this button anywhere in the app temporarily:

```typescript
import { router } from 'expo-router';

<TouchableOpacity 
  onPress={() => router.push({
    pathname: '/(modals)/payment',
    params: {
      amount: '500',
      description: 'Test Payment',
    }
  })}
>
  <Text>Test Payment</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

**Option B: Integrate into your existing flow:**

Navigate to payment from job acceptance, wallet top-up, etc.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No real money involved
- ✅ No Fatora API calls
- ✅ Instant processing (2 seconds)
- ✅ Test success/failure flows
- ✅ Perfect for development

**How to Enable:**

Demo mode is **enabled by default** in development. If you need to enable it manually:

```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.34:5000/api/demo-mode/enable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Click "Pay 500.00 QAR Securely"
2. WebView opens with: `http://backend/demo/payment/demo_txn_...`
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Success! WebView closes automatically
5. See success message

### **Mode 2: Production/Test Mode** (Real Fatora integration)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Real Fatora payment page
- ✅ Test with Fatora test cards
- ✅ Full payment flow
- ✅ Webhook testing

**How to Enable:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.34:5000/api/demo-mode/disable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Click "Pay 500.00 QAR Securely"
2. WebView opens Fatora page: `https://maktapp.credit/pay/...`
3. Enter test card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
4. Expiry: `12/25`, CVV: `123`
5. Click "Pay"
6. Success! WebView closes
7. See success message

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when you see:

### **In Mobile App:**
- ✅ Payment screen loads with correct amount
- ✅ "Pay Securely" button responds
- ✅ Loading indicator appears
- ✅ WebView opens (full screen with header)
- ✅ Payment page loads in WebView
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ Returns to previous screen

### **In Backend Console:**
- ✅ `💳 Creating payment checkout for order ORD-...`

- ✅ `💳 WebView URL changed: ...`
- ✅ `✅ Payment successful!`

### **No Errors:**
- ✅ No "Backend connection failed"
- ✅ No "Payment initialization failed"
- ✅ No WebView loading errors

---

## 🐛 **Quick Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Backend won't start**

```bash
# Check if port 5000 is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# If in use, kill the process or change port in backend/.env
```

### **Problem: "Backend connection failed"**

1. Check backend is running: `curl http://192.168.1.34:5000/health`
2. Check IP address in `src/config/backend.ts`
3. For Android emulator, use `10.0.2.2:5000` instead of `192.168.1.34:5000`

### **Problem: WebView shows blank page**

1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify Fatora API key is valid (if in production mode)
3. Try demo mode first to isolate issue

### **Problem: Success not detected**

1. Check backend logs: did payment complete?
2. Check WebView URL changes in console
3. Verify URL patterns in `PaymentWebView.tsx`

## 📱 **Device-Specific Notes**

### **iOS Simulator:**
- ✅ Works perfectly
