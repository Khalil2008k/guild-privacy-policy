## 🧪 **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Unit Tests**
```typescript

- calculateTotalValue()
- selectCoins()
- calculateOptimalPack()

// LedgerService
- createEntry()
- idempotency check

// CoinWalletService
- addCoins()
- deductCoins()
- atomic operations
```

### **Integration Tests**
```typescript
// Purchase Flow
- Create purchase → Webhook → Issue coins

// Job Payment Flow
- Lock coins → Complete job → Release escrow

// Withdrawal Flow
- Request → Approve → Mark paid → Deduct coins
```

### **E2E Tests**
```typescript
// User Journey
1. Sign up → Verify KYC
2. Buy coins → Receive coins
3. Post job → Pay with coins
4. Complete job → Receive payment
5. Request withdrawal → Receive money
```
