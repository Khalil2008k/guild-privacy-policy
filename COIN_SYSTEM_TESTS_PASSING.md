## 📦 **WHAT YOU NEED TO SET UP**

### **1. Firestore Collections & Indexes**

I've created a complete setup guide:
- 📄 **`FIRESTORE_COIN_SYSTEM_SETUP.md`** - Full documentation
- 📄 **`firestore.indexes.json`** - Auto-deploy indexes

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
cd GUILD-3/backend

# Deploy indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Deploy security rules (already done, but to update)
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Required Collections:**
1. ✅ `coin_instances` - Individual serialized coins
2. ✅ `coin_counters` - Serial number generation
3. ✅ `merkle_roots` - Batch verification
4. ✅ `quarantined_coins` - Fraud detection
5. ✅ `security_alerts` - Real-time alerts
6. ✅ `wallets` - Enhanced with coin inventory
7. ✅ `ledger` - Enhanced with coin serials

**Required Indexes:** 8 composite indexes (auto-created from JSON file)

---

## 🔐 **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

Add these to Render (backend):

```bash
# Coin System Security (CRITICAL - Generate secure random values!)
COIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64-character-hex-string>
COIN_SIGNATURE_SECRET=<128-character-hex-string>
COIN_SALT=<32-character-hex-string>
```

**Generate secure values:**
```bash
# On your local machine
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"  # COIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"  # COIN_SIGNATURE_SECRET
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"  # COIN_SALT
```
