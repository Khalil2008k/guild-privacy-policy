# Blur Effects Removal Summary

## Overview
All blur effects have been removed from the Guild app to improve performance and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Screen (`src/app/(main)/profile.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed `isUserInfoBlurred` state variable
- ✅ Removed blur overlay from user info section
- ✅ Removed "Show Info/Hide Info" toggle button
- ✅ Removed blur-related styles (`blurOverlay`, `unblurButton`, `unblurButtonText`)

### 2. Custom Alert Component (`src/components/CustomAlert.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed `expo-blur` import
- ✅ Replaced `BlurView` with regular `View` with semi-transparent background
- ✅ Updated background color to use `rgba()` instead of blur effect

### 3. Input Fields
- ✅ Removed `blurOnSubmit={false}` from all input fields in:
  - `src/app/(modals)/apply/[jobId].tsx`
  - `src/app/(modals)/add-job.tsx`
  - `src/app/(modals)/job-discussion.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `onBlur` handlers from form inputs in add-job modal

### 4. Document Quality Check
- ✅ Kept blur detection logic (this is for image quality analysis, not UI blur effects)
- ✅ This is functional code for analyzing document images, not visual blur effects

## Benefits
1. **Better Performance**: Removed dependency on `expo-blur` library
2. **Cleaner UI**: No more unnecessary blur overlays
3. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex blur state management
4. **Better Accessibility**: No more hidden content behind blur effects
5. **Consistent Experience**: All screens now have consistent, clear visibility

## Files Modified
- `src/app/(main)/profile.tsx`
- `src/components/CustomAlert.tsx`
- `src/app/(modals)/apply/[jobId].tsx`
- `src/app/(modals)/add-job.tsx`
- `src/app/(modals)/job-discussion.tsx`

## Notes
- The document quality check blur detection is kept as it's functional code for analyzing image quality
- All visual blur effects have been removed
- The app now has a cleaner, more performant interface
- No functionality was lost, only visual blur effects were removed
