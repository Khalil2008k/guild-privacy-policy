## ⚙️ **Environment Variables Setup:**

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Fatora Payment Gateway Configuration

# PRODUCTION (Live payments)
FATORA_API_KEY=E4B73FEE-F492-4607-A38D-852B0EBC91C9
FATORA_URL=https://api.fatora.io/v1
FATORA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here

# TEST (Development/Sandbox)
FATORA_TEST_API_KEY=your-test-key-here
FATORA_TEST_URL=https://sandbox.fatora.io/v1
FATORA_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-test-webhook-secret

# Application URLs
BACKEND_URL=https://api.guild.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://guild.app

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production  # or 'development' for testing
```

---

## 🔧 **Integration Created:**

I've created the complete Fatora integration:

### **Files Created:**
1. ✅ `backend/src/services/FatoraPaymentService.ts` - Payment service
2. ✅ `FATORA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - This guide

### **Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Create payment checkout
- ✅ Verify payment status
- ✅ Process refunds
- ✅ Handle webhooks
- ✅ Signature verification
- ✅ Test/Production mode switching
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Logging

---

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **1. User Makes Payment:**
```
1. User orders service (e.g., hire freelancer)
2. Backend creates Fatora checkout:
   POST /api/payments/fatora/checkout
3. User gets payment_url
4. User completes payment in Fatora
5. Fatora redirects to success_url
6. Backend receives webhook notification
7. Order is fulfilled
```

### **2. Payment Flow:**
```
GUILD App → Backend API → Fatora API
                ↓
        Fatora Payment Page
                ↓
        User Pays with Card
                ↓
        Fatora Webhook → Backend
                ↓
        Order Updated → User Notified
```

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### **Test Mode Features:**
```

```

## 📊 **API Usage Example:**

### **Create Checkout:**
```typescript
import { fatoraPaymentService } from './services/FatoraPaymentService';

// Create payment
const result = await fatoraPaymentService.createCheckout({
  amount: 500.00,
  orderId: 'ORD-12345',
  clientName: 'Ahmed Al-Mansoori',
  clientPhone: '+97433445566',
  clientEmail: 'ahmed@example.com',
  note: 'Hire freelancer for mobile app development',
  language: 'en'
});

if (result.success) {
  // Redirect user to payment_url
  console.log('Payment URL:', result.payment_url);
  console.log('Payment ID:', result.payment_id);
} else {
  // Handle error
  console.error('Error:', result.error);
}
```

### **Verify Payment:**
```typescript
// Check payment status
const status = await fatoraPaymentService.verifyPayment('payment-id-123');

if (status.success && status.status === 'success') {
  console.log('Payment successful!');
  console.log('Amount:', status.amount);
  console.log('Order ID:', status.order_id);
}
```

### **Process Refund:**
```typescript
// Full refund
const refund = await fatoraPaymentService.refundPayment('payment-id-123');

// Partial refund
const partialRefund = await fatoraPaymentService.refundPayment('payment-id-123', 250.00);

if (refund.success) {
  console.log('Refund ID:', refund.refund_id);
}
```

## 🔐 **Security:**

### **Webhook Security:**
```
✅ Signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
