# 🚨 **CRITICAL: DELETE EXPO GO APP AND REINSTALL!**

## 😱 **THE PROBLEM:**

The Firebase Auth session is **CACHED IN MEMORY** inside Expo Go itself!

Even though we cleared AsyncStorage, the **Expo Go app** still has the old Firebase Auth session from `guild-4f46b` in memory.

**Backend logs confirm:**
```
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Error Message: ... Expected "guild-dev-7f06e" but got "guild-4f46b"
```

---

## 💣 **THE ONLY SOLUTION: DELETE EXPO GO!**

### **ON YOUR ANDROID DEVICE:**

1. **Long-press the Expo Go app icon**
2. **Tap "App info" or "Uninstall"**
3. **Tap "Storage"**
4. **Tap "Clear data" AND "Clear cache"**
5. **Uninstall the app completely**
6. **Restart your phone** (important!)
7. **Reinstall Expo Go from Google Play Store**
8. **Restart Expo on your computer:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Admin\GUILD\GUILD-3
   npx expo start --clear
   ```
9. **Scan the QR code with the FRESH Expo Go app**
10. **Sign in with `demo@guild.app` / `Demo@2025`**

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS WILL WORK:**

- ✅ Deleting Expo Go **destroys** the cached Firebase Auth instance
- ✅ Reinstalling Expo Go gives you a **clean slate**
- ✅ Restarting your phone **clears all memory caches**
- ✅ The new session will use the **CORRECT** Firebase project (`guild-dev-7f06e`)

## 🔍 **AFTER REINSTALLING, CHECK FOR:**

### **Frontend logs should show:**
```
🔥 FIREBASE PROJECT ID: guild-dev-7f06e
🔥 FIREBASE AUTH DOMAIN: guild-dev-7f06e.firebaseapp.com
✅ Firebase Auth cache cleared!
```

### **Backend logs should show:**
```
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Token verified successfully! User ID: 1TwSrYTugUSF7V0B31jXkTlMKgr1
```

**NOT:**
```
🔥 [FIREBASE AUTH] Error Message: ... Expected "guild-dev-7f06e" but got "guild-4f46b"
```

---

## 📝 **ALTERNATIVE: Use Development Build Instead**

If this doesn't work, we need to create a **development build** instead of using Expo Go:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\GUILD\GUILD-3
npx expo install expo-dev-client
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

This will create a standalone app with the correct Firebase config baked in.

---

## ⚠️ **I ALSO UPDATED THE CODE:**

I enhanced `clearFirebaseCache.ts` to:
1. Sign out any existing Firebase Auth session
2. Clear ALL AsyncStorage keys (not just Firebase ones)
3. Clear IndexedDB (for web compatibility)

But this **WON'T HELP** if Expo Go has the session cached in memory!

**DELETE EXPO GO, RESTART YOUR PHONE, REINSTALL, AND TRY AGAIN!** 🔥🔥🔥
