## 🟡 Minor Issues

### 1. **User Wallet Screen** - Mixed Currency References
**File**: `src/app/(modals)/wallet/[userId].tsx`
**Issue**: This screen shows "QAR" currency but should show coins
**Lines**: 128, 170-174
**Impact**: Low - This is a user-to-user wallet view screen (not commonly used)
**Status**: ⏳ To Fix

**Details**:
- Line 128: `currency: 'QAR'` in withdrawal request
- Line 170-174: `formatCurrency` function handles both QAR and Guild Coins

**Recommendation**: 
- This screen appears to be for viewing OTHER users' wallets
- May be deprecated or needs update to show coins only
- Check if this screen is even used in the app flow

```typescript
// ❌ Current
content: 'Let's set up your profile...'
