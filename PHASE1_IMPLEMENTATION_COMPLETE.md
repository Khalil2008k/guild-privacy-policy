## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### **1. Apply Screen Backend Integration** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**File:** `src/app/(modals)/apply/[jobId].tsx`

const response = await BackendAPI.post(`/v1/jobs/${jobId}/offers`, {
  budget: price,
  timeline: timeline.trim(),
  message: coverLetter.trim(),
  coverLetter: coverLetter.trim()
});
```

**Error Handling:**
