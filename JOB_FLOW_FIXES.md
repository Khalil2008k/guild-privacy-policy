# Job Flow Logic Fixes

## üêõ Issues Found & Fixed

### **Issue 1: Doer Wallet Balance Check** ‚ùå
**Problem**: The job-accept screen was checking if the DOER had enough coins, which is incorrect.

**Why it's wrong**: 
- Only the POSTER (client) needs coins to pay for the job
- The DOER (freelancer) is the one RECEIVING payment, not paying
- Coins should be deducted from the POSTER's wallet when they accept the doer's offer

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// REMOVED THIS INCORRECT CODE:
if (!wallet || wallet.balance < proposedAmount) {
  CustomAlertService.showError(
    t('error'),
    isRTL ? 'ÿ±ÿµŸäÿØ ÿπŸÖŸÑÿßÿ™ŸÉ ÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ŸÉÿßŸÅŸç' : 'Insufficient coin balance'
  );
  return;
}
```

### **Issue 2: Doer Adding Terms** ‚ùå
**Problem**: The job-accept screen had a "terms" input field for the doer to add contract terms.

**Why it's wrong**:
- Contract terms are set by the POSTER when creating the job
- The DOER should only propose a price and timeline
- Terms are part of the job requirements, not the offer

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed the `terms` state variable
- Removed the "Additional Terms" input field from the UI
- Updated the offer submission to only include price and timeline

### **Issue 3: Confusing Flow Naming** ‚ùå
**Problem**: The screen was called "Accept Job" but was actually for submitting an offer.

**Why it's confusing**:
- "Accept Job" implies the doer is accepting the job directly
- In reality, the doer is SUBMITTING AN OFFER that the poster must accept
- This creates confusion about who pays and when

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated button text from "Accept Job" to "Send Offer"
- Updated success message to clarify the offer is pending client acceptance
- Changed button icon from `CheckCircle` to `Send`
- Updated loading state text from "Accepting..." to "Sending..."

## ‚úÖ Correct Job Flow

### **Step 1: Poster Creates Job**
- Poster creates a job with budget, requirements, and terms
- Job is posted to the platform
- **No coins deducted yet**

### **Step 2: Doer Submits Offer**
- Doer sees the job and clicks "Apply"
- Doer enters proposed price (in QR) and timeline
- Doer submits offer
- **No coins deducted yet** (doer doesn't pay anything!)

### **Step 3: Poster Reviews & Accepts Offer**
- Poster reviews all offers from doers
- Poster selects the best offer and accepts it
- **Coins are deducted from POSTER's wallet** (escrow created)
- Contract is created automatically

### **Step 4: Doer Completes Work**
- Doer works on the job according to agreed terms
- Doer marks job as complete
- **90% of coins go to doer, 10% platform fee**

### **Step 5: Dispute Handling (if needed)**
- If there's an issue, either party can raise a dispute
- Admin reviews and decides where coins go
- Coins can go to doer, poster, or be split

  3. Coins are deducted from client's wallet (escrow)
  4. Complete work and receive 90% of amount

### **Button Styling**
