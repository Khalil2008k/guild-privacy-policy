# ✅ TASK 15: Organization Developer Account - COMPLETE

**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Time Spent:** 15 minutes (documentation)  
**Status:** 🟢 COMPLETE

---

## 📋 OBJECTIVE

Provide comprehensive documentation for setting up an **Apple Developer Organization Account** for the GUILD app, as required for App Store submission of business/enterprise applications.

---

## 🎯 WHY ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT IS REQUIRED

### **Apple Requirements:**

**Individual Account vs Organization Account:**

| Feature | Individual Account | Organization Account |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **App Name** | Personal name | Company name |
| **Legal Entity** | Individual | Company/Organization |
| **Team Management** | No | Yes (multiple users) |
| **Business Apps** | Limited | Full support |
| **In-App Purchases** | Yes | Yes |
| **TestFlight** | 100 testers | 10,000 testers |
| **Cost** | $99/year | $99/year |

**For GUILD, you NEED an Organization Account because:**
1. ✅ **Business Application** - GUILD is a service marketplace platform
2. ✅ **Team Collaboration** - Multiple developers/testers need access
3. ✅ **Professional Branding** - App should show company name, not individual
4. ✅ **Legal Protection** - Separates personal liability from business
5. ✅ **Scalability** - Easier to add team members as you grow
