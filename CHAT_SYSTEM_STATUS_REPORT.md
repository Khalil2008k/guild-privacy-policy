## 📝 INTEGRATION NEEDED

The service is built but needs to be integrated into message sending:

```typescript
// In ChatMessage component, when message sent:
await disputeLoggingService.logMessage(
  messageId,
  chatId,
  senderId,
  recipientIds,
  content,
  attachments
);

// When message edited:
await disputeLoggingService.logEdit(
  messageId,
  editorId,
  originalContent,
  newContent
);

// When message deleted:
await disputeLoggingService.logDeletion(
  messageId,
  deletedBy,
  originalContent
);
```

**Estimate:** 30 minutes to integrate.
