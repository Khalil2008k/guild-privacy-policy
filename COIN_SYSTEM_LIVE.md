4. ⏳ Create `admin/withdrawal-management.tsx` - Admin console

**All code is in the documentation files - just copy and customize!**

### **Database Setup**
1. ⏳ Create Firestore indexes (see `COIN_SYSTEM_README.md`)
2. ⏳ Update Firestore rules (see `COIN_SYSTEM_README.md`)
3. ⏳ Initialize collections (see `COIN_SYSTEM_README.md`)

### **Integration**
1. ⏳ Update job posting screen (add coin payment option)
2. ⏳ Update main wallet screen (add coin wallet button)
