## 💡 **TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS**

### **Atomic Transactions**
All coin operations use Firestore transactions to ensure data consistency:
- Purchase → Issue coins + Update vault
- Job payment → Lock escrow + Deduct coins
- Release → Distribute coins + Update stats
- Withdrawal → Deduct coins + Create request

### **Idempotency Protection**
Every operation has a unique idempotency key:
- Prevents duplicate purchases
- Prevents double-spending
- Prevents duplicate withdrawals
- Ensures data integrity

### **Comprehensive Logging**
Every operation is logged:
- User actions
- Admin actions
- System events
- Errors and warnings

### **Security**
- Firebase authentication required
- Admin-only endpoints protected
- KYC verification for withdrawals
- Balance validation before operations
