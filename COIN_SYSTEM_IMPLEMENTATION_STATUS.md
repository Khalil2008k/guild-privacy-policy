## 🎯 **KEY DESIGN DECISIONS**

### **1. Coin Selection Algorithm**
- **Greedy Algorithm** (largest coins first)
- Automatic selection for optimal user experience
- Users can buy MORE coins than needed (encourages retention)

### **2. Guild Vault Rules**
- ❌ No manual deposits from personal wallet
- ❌ No direct coin purchases for guild
- ✅ Coins come ONLY from guild jobs (automatic split)
- ✅ Guild vault has same withdrawal system as personal wallet
- ✅ Guild master has TWO separate wallets (personal + guild)

### **3. Expiry Policy**
- ✅ Purchased coins: **Never expire**
- ✅ Earned/bonus coins: Expire after **24 months** of inactivity
- ✅ Warnings: 30/7/1 days before expiry

### **4. Withdrawal System**
- ✅ **No limits** on withdrawal amount
- ✅ **10-14 days** processing time
- ✅ **KYC required** (already integrated)
- ✅ **Admin approval** for all withdrawals (Phase 1)
- 🚧 **Auto-approval** for small amounts (Phase 2 - future)

### **5. Platform Fees**
- **Coin Purchase:** 10% markup (user pays 110 QAR, gets 100 QAR in coins)
- **Job Completion:** 10% platform fee (90% to freelancer, 10% to platform)
- **PSP Fee:** 2.5% absorbed by platform (not passed to user)
- **Total Platform Revenue:** ~17.5% effective rate
