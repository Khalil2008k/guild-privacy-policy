## 💡 **KEY DECISIONS ALREADY MADE**

You don't need to decide these - they're already designed:

✅ **6-tier coin system** (Bronze → Royal)  
✅ **10% markup** on purchases  
✅ **10% platform fee** on jobs  
✅ **Greedy algorithm** for coin selection  
✅ **24-month expiry** (purchased never expire)  
✅ **No withdrawal limits** (10-14 days processing)  
✅ **KYC required** for withdrawals  
✅ **Admin approval** for all withdrawals  
✅ **Guild vault** (separate from personal)  
✅ **Atomic transactions** (Firestore)  
✅ **Append-only ledger** (full audit trail)  
✅ **Idempotency keys** (prevent duplicates)
