## 🔐 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### **Coin Lifecycle:**

```
1. MINTING
   ↓
   Generate secure serial: GBC-20251022-000001-A3F5D8E2
   ↓
   Create signature: HMAC-SHA256(serial + metadata)
   ↓
   Encrypt serial: AES-256-GCM
   ↓
   Store in coin_instances collection
   ↓
   Add to Merkle tree for batch verification

2. OWNERSHIP
   ↓
   Store encrypted serial in user wallet
   ↓
   Track in coinInventory.active[]
   ↓
   Log in ledger with full audit trail

3. SPENDING
   ↓
   Verify signature & ownership
   ↓
   Select coins (FIFO)
   ↓
   Move to coinInventory.locked[]
   ↓
   Atomic transaction (deduct from sender, add to receiver)
   ↓
   Update coin_instances status to 'spent'
   ↓
   Log in ledger

4. FRAUD DETECTION
   ↓
   Check serial authenticity (checksum)
   ↓
   Verify cryptographic signature
   ↓
   Validate ownership chain
   ↓
   Check Merkle tree inclusion
   ↓
   If fake → Quarantine + Alert admin
```

### **Encryption Keys (Backend Only):**
```
COIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY - AES-256 key (32 bytes)
COIN_SIGNATURE_SECRET - HMAC secret (64 bytes)
COIN_SALT - Checksum salt (16 bytes)
```

**Frontend NEVER sees:**
- Real serial numbers (encrypted)
- Encryption keys
- Signature secrets
- Merkle proofs
